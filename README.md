# Getting Started with Nx and pnpm
Before diving into Nx, you need to have pnpm installed on your system. If you haven't installed pnpm yet, follow these steps:

## Install pnpm:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
Verify the installation:
```
```bash
pnpm -v
```

## Install Dependencies

```pnpm
pnpm install
```
 
## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `pnpm nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

### Generate a js library

```bash
pnpm nx g @nx/js:lib <lib name> --directoryName=libs/<lib name>
```

### Generate app

```bash
pnpm nx g @nx/js:app <app name> --directoryName=apps/<app name>
```

### Or react app

```bash
pnpm add -D @nx/react
pnpm nx g @nx/react:app <app name> --directoryName=apps/<app name>
```

## Import libs in workspace

```typescript
import {code} from '@e2b/<lib name>'

```


## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
pnpm nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
pnpm nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
pnpm nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `pnpm nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
